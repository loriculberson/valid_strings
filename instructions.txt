You know my powers, my dear Watson, and yet at the end of three months I was forced to confess that I had at last met an antagonist who was my intellectual equal.

A "valid" string is a string  such that for all distinct characters in  each such character occurs the same number of times in .

For example, aabb is a valid string because the frequency of both characters a and b is 2, whereas aabbc is not a valid string because the frequency of characters a, b, and c is not the same.

Watson gives a string  to Sherlock and asks him to remove some characters from the string such that the new string is a "valid" string.

Sherlock wants to know from you if it's possible to be done with less than or equal to one removal.

Constraints

Output Format

Else, output NO.

Explanation

 is the minimum number of removals required to make it a valid string. It can be done in following two ways:

Or remove a and b to get abcd.
